Return all information of a user with id of {id}
  Could be used in say a GET request to `edit user profile` to get all information about a user.
  If the user wants to say, make changes, the input fields can be populated with the information of the user so that they see the initial value of a field before they make a change.
  Cannot be accessed by a user with a different id than specified in the parameters. User needs to be logged in (have a valid JWT).
  Therefore to get the information a user <User 1> with id of 1, a GET request can be sent to `/users/1/tests` by <User 1>
