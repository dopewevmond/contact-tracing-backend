Check if a location exists in the database.
  The AWS location is used in this API to allow users to search locations and to access geocoding features.
  If a user visited a location called say `Area 51` and they wanted to add it to their location history, they will first search with AWS Location API to get the geocoordinates of `Area 51`.
  They can then check with the coordinates of `Area 51` if it exists in the database on this route.
